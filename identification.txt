a.) For me single-threaded is a single task execution of any program which is used usually in websites or web servers to
    maintain its accuracy and fast execution or loading of data. It is reliable and fast now adays since its uses effecient
    multiple cores of a CPU and also it depends on the settings.
    
b.) Event driven architechture is a system's way of handling certain or specific event from user. Usually one server will handle
    multiple users or clients that will give a possible problems like server down. But through event driven architecture this solution
    will only read execution once and will wait for it to be loaded. For the mean time while waiting, it will also execute another event
    from another user.
  
c.) The benefits of having javascript module is that it is accurate and well organized coding that will be more standards among devices such as ANDROIDS, WEBSITES,
    and other devices that uses java. Since it is usually used in knowned systems they friendly to devices among all of the programming languages.
    
d.) 1.) AMD(Asychronous Module Definition 
    2.) CommonJS.

e.) Module Bundler is like library package, web package, that will be used by calling certain imports and includes to be able
    to program according to its usage that will depend on the programmer's needs. Without Module Bundler usually if it is not
    built-in within its platform it will cause and error or it cannot read/locate from the system.
